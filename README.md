# noise-warden

Pi-deployable nuisance noise incident logging, management, and reporting tool (web interface for both access and configuration)

<details>

<summary>Why?</summary>

Well, to make a very long story short, sometimes people choose to be loud and obnoxious. And everyone else just gets to suffer, despite there regularly being city noise ordinances, HOA codes of conduct, and apartment tenant agreements that are supposed to protect us all.

Now, let's be clear, I don't mean the occasional Super Bowl party. I mean people who care so little about how they impact others' lives that they will run air compressors and play rap music at 11pm or 6am or whatever suits them without a thought for the newborn their neighbor just got to sleep, the neighborhood children who have school the next day, or the graveyard shift you just finished.

Yes. All of these are examples from my life, each of them in different cities with different neighbors. Our current neighbor takes the cake, though. He stuck an amplified music system in his garage, and started playing frankly terrible music for _hours_ at a time, sending the bass vibrating through my house, night and day. We begged each to be reasonable humans, but each refused. We had begged each jerk in the past to be reasonable humans, but each refused, and this piece was no exception. Recently, after finally giving in and calling the city hotline to report a noise disturbance, only to have my neighbor turn his music back down to still-technically-violating-the-noise-ordinance-but-quiet-enough-no-one-can-reasonably-complain levels, I decided to get quantifiable irrefutable proof on my side. Something that I could show on my phone to a patrolman or take into city council and have them instantly see and understand the recent violations and impact. Especially because for me, I was able to program in the exact city noise ordinance as the trigger threshold.

> **Important:** This project is designed for **evidence collection and automation experiments**. It is **not a certified ANSI Type 1/2 sound level meter** and should **not** be relied upon as the sole proof of a legal violation. Your city code, like mine, may explicitly say sound level measurements are *desirable but not required* if other evidence/testimony establishes a disturbance. Use this as a logging/correlation tool, not a courtroom laser cannon.

## How it works

```
Microphone → USB Audio → Metric Computation → Exclusion Filters
  → Threshold Evaluation (day/night ordinance-aware)
  → Incident State Machine (hysteresis + song-gap merging)
  → SQLite Incident Log + WAV Snippet Capture
  → Web Dashboard ↔ REST API
  → (Optional) GPIO Relay + Audio Playback Retaliation
```

The system runs a continuous background thread that monitors audio in 1-second blocks against configurable ordinance-aligned thresholds. It distinguishes between genuine nuisance noise and common false positives (impulses, thunder, rain, lawn equipment, drive-bys), merges closely-spaced events into single incidents, and captures WAV snippet evidence with pre-trigger audio buffering.

During **daytime** (7 AM–10 PM), the system can optionally activate a GPIO relay to power an amplifier and play audio in response. During **nighttime** (10 PM–7 AM), it records incidents only — no response activation.

## Ordinance basis (my city, UT residential)

| Category | Day (7 AM–10 PM) | Night (10 PM–7 AM) |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Continuous | 65 dBA (SLOW) | 55 dBA (SLOW) |
| Intermittent | 70 dBA (SLOW) | 60 dBA (SLOW) |
| Impulse | 75 dBA (FAST) | 60 dBA (FAST) |

These are the defaults. Configuration supports any jurisdiction's thresholds.

## Setup

### Requirements

- A directional (shotgun/cardioid/super cardioid) USB microphone
- Pi 3 or better device and power supply with a minimum of:
  - 90% availability on two cores at 1GHz+ (process needs to be immediately responsive)
  - 3GB available RAM (only needed when tracking extremely long-running incidents)
  - However much storage space you want to dedicate to evidence recording

  > I highly recommend a Pi 4+, as the increased CPU and RAM speed helps cut down on processing time, which in turn actually keeps the overhead of the system low.

### Hardware BOM

#### Core

- **Raspberry Pi 4B (4 GB)** or **Raspberry Pi 5** — Pi 4 is sufficient; Pi 5 is snappier
- **Official Pi PSU**
- **32–128 GB microSD** (A2-rated) or SSD boot

#### Audio input

- **USB audio interface** — class-compliant, stable Linux support (e.g., UGREEN / Sabrent USB dongle). Avoid the Pi's onboard analog jack.
- **Directional microphone** — Budget: Boya BY-MM1 shotgun. Better: RØDE VideoMic GO II.
- **Windscreen / deadcat** — critical for outdoor or window-adjacent placement
- Optional: secondary mic (for dual-mic differential rejection testing), reference loopback capture path (for adaptive subtraction)

#### Audio output / response (optional)

- **Class D amp board** (e.g., TPA3116/TPA3118)
- **12V power supply** for amp
- **Passive speaker(s)** — outdoor-rated or indoor window-facing
- **5V opto-isolated 1-channel relay module** — controls amp power. Prefer switching amp enable/remote turn-on rather than mains AC.

#### Optional upgrades

- I2S MEMS mic (INMP441) for cleaner digital chain
- Calibrated SPL meter for one-time calibration cross-check
- UPS HAT or USB UPS for power continuity

### Installation

1. Clone this repository on your Pi (or download, transfer, and extract an archive)
2. Run the install script:
    ```bash
    cd noise-warden
    ./scripts/install_pi.sh
    ```
    This will: install system dependencies (`python3-venv`, `portaudio19-dev`, `libsndfile1`, `ffmpeg`), create a Python venv, install pip dependencies, create data directories, and install a systemd service.
3. Edit the configuration:
    ```bash
    nano config/noise_warden.yaml
    ```
4. Enable and start the service:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable --now noise-warden
    ```
5. Open in browser: `http://<pi-ip>:8787/`

## Configuration (IMPORTANT!)

> NOTE: It is extremely important that you take at least a little time to configure, calibrate, and test your setup. Every microphone, environment, and personal irritation threshold is different.

After running the install script and starting the service, it is time to calibrate your system.

Configuration is stored in `config/noise_warden.yaml` and can also be edited via the web UI at `/config`. Key sections:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `site` | City name and ordinance reference |
| `audio` | Sample rate, block size, device selection, mic calibration offset, secondary/reference mic toggles, snippet pre/post buffer durations |
| `gpio` | Relay pin, active-high/low, enable toggle |
| `response` | Daytime audio response toggle, playlist directory, player command, amp power-on delay |
| `rules` | Day/night schedule, dB thresholds, evaluation interval, release/merge/minimum duration timings, hysteresis |
| `filters` | Per-filter enable toggles and tuning parameters for impulse, drive-by, mower-like, thunder-like, and rain-like exclusions |
| `web` | Host, port, dashboard refresh interval |

## Features

- **Intelligent gating, recording, and logging of incidents** — hysteresis-based state machine prevents chatter at threshold boundaries; song-gap merging (default 10 sec) bundles closely-spaced noise events into single incidents
- **WAV snippet evidence capture** — ring buffer preserves pre-trigger audio (15 sec default) plus post-trigger recording, saved per incident
- **5 false-positive exclusion filters** — impulse, thunder-like, rain-like, mower-like, and drive-by patterns each with configurable tuning parameters
- **Web UI** for calibration, customization, and incident review:
  - Dashboard — live dB readout, arm/disarm controls, incident list with audio playback
  - Timeline — day/week/month incident viewer
  - Thresholds — display current thresholds vs. ordinance limits
  - Config editor — edit YAML configuration without SSH
  - Build documentation — upload photos and notes documenting physical setup
- **Day/night ordinance enforcement** — separate thresholds and behavior; nighttime is record-only
- **GPIO relay + audio playback response** (optional, disabled by default) — powers amplifier and plays audio during daytime threshold violations
- **REST API** — full programmatic access to status, incidents, controls, and configuration
- **CSV export** of incident history for external analysis or evidence submission
- **Home Assistant integration** — REST endpoint examples provided for status polling and control commands
- **Noise exclusion profiles** for common false positives (lawn mower, thunder, rain, drive-bys, etc.)
- **Multi-mic scaffolding** — optional secondary mic for differential rejection and reference input for adaptive subtraction (experimental)


## Notes on legal / practical reality

- My local noise ordinance says measurements should align to ANSI Type 1/2 instruments, but this is **not** one. The code mirrors the *logic* (A-weighted, slow/fast behavior, day/night thresholds) but is _not_ certification-grade.
- My ordinance also states measurements are not strictly required if other evidence/testimony shows a disturbance. This makes my log + timestamps + trend data useful even if my meter is not admissible as a formal calibrated instrument.
- Use the response mode conservatively. The most defensible and neighbor-safe deployment is: **log always, manual review, response disabled by default until calibrated and tested**.
